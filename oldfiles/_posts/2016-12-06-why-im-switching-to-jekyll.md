A simple blog requires a simple solution.  While I have other projects running that use more bloated solutions, this site is essentially just a simple blog.

# So Why Jekyll?

For one, it forces me to learn something new.  The idea of creating posts in a text editor and 'git pushing' the posts was not at all appealing at first.  But then the idea grew on me.  I'm forcing myself into a web development workflow and will inevitably learn more about Markdown, Git, Liquid, and possibly Ruby.

In addition to learning something new, I like the simplicity in approach.  A static website without a database should be fast.
