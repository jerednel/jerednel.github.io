I've been working from home for a month now and so far it's just as great as I would have imagined.  There were some initial challenges that took a bit of getting used to but I think that this is something that I'll not only personally enjoy but that will lend itself to getting more done.

Collaboration is always tricky with a distributed team, but i've found that one thing that really helps is just enabling video in your team calls.  I was reticent to do this at first because I wasn't used to being on video for company meetings but after doing it a few times it became normal and now I think I prefer to be on video for team meetings since it is easier to pay attention and measure the response of the people you're talking with.

Google Hangouts has been an immense part of this.
